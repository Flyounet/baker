##about this blog

This is a delayed post about the new bash static site generator, baker. After I finish the bash template engine, I understand why bash people are angry all the time...

here are my todo list:

* monthly archive
* category or tag
* comment
* page

..more, but I am satisfied with what I get now.

##is goolog dead?

goolog is my first blog written in php. Now it is taken down from the github repo. It reminds me how I learn html, css and most importantly php. but this year is 2013; there are too many good technologies out there. For example, node.js is certainly better than php when one looks at the performance.

##laravel?

Also this week I take a look at laravel. If you like the term "ruby on rails", you will also like the term "php on laravel". It is beautifully writen by Taylor Otwell..I mean everything. The only thing that holds me back is that it uses big components from symphony. But if you think about how many disk space your laptop has, 32mb is no big deal.
